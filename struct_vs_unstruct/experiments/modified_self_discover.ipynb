Does the problem involve decision-making or planning, where choices need to be made under uncertainty or with competing objectives?\\n29. Is the problem an analytical one that requires data analysis, modeling, or optimization techniques?\\n30. Is the problem a design challenge that requires creative solutions and innovation?\\n31. Does the problem require addressing systemic or structural issues rather than just individual instances?\\n32. Is the problem time-sensitive or urgent, requiring immediate attention and action?\\n33. What kinds of solution typically are produced for this kind of problem specification?\\n34. Given the problem specification and the current best solution, have a guess about other possible solutions.35. Let’s imagine the current best solution is totally wrong, what other ways are there to think about the problem specification?36. What is the best way to modify this current best solution, given what you know about these kinds of problem specification?37.
