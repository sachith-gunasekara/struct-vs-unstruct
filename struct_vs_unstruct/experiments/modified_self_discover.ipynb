      "\"Step 5: Creative Thinking - Generate innovative and out-of-the-box ideas\":\n",
      "\"Explore unconventional solutions, think beyond traditional boundaries, and encourage imagination and originality. Consider alternative ways for Mila to access the hat, such as asking Alexander or Charlotte for permission to use it, or finding a similar hat elsewhere.\"\n",

      "\"Step 6: Problem Simplification - Identify the core issue or problem\":\n",
      "\"Identify the core issue as 'how to make the hat accessible to Mila' and break it down into smaller, more manageable parts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Step 7: Stakeholder Analysis - Identify stakeholders and their perspectives\":\n",
      "\"Identify Alexander, Charlotte, and Mila as stakeholders and consider their respective needs and perspectives when developing a solution.\"\n",

      "\"Analyze data on the location of the hat and the plans of Alexander and Charlotte to determine the likelihood of Mila being able to use the hat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Step 10: Design Thinking - Develop creative solutions and innovation\":\n",
      "\"Develop a solution that takes into account the needs and preferences of Alexander, Charlotte, and Mila, such as creating a shared calendar or communication system to coordinate hat usage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Step 11: Implementation Planning - Develop a step-by-step plan to implement solutions\":\n",
      "\"Develop a plan to implement a solution such as asking Alexander or Charlotte for permission to use the hat, including identifying the resources needed, potential obstacles, and metrics for success.\"\n",
      "\n",
