### Step-by-Step Execution:

**Step 1: Simplify the Sorting Task**
- **Action**: No duplicates are present, and no obvious patterns need preliminary steps.

**Step 2: Break Down the List into Smaller Groups**
- **Action**: Split the list into smaller sublists:
  - Sublist 1: hornblower, dissipate, amanita, canticle, annoy
  - Sublist 2: besiege, straight, notre, propylene, sepia
  - Sublist 3: california, pasture, encephalitis, boggle, crocodilian
  - Sublist 4: dexter, snipe, amatory, dizzy, psychiatric

**Step 3: Analyze Sorting Techniques**
- **Action**: A simple alphabetical sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort) is sufficient.

**Step 4: Create a Step-by-Step Plan for Sorting**
- **Action**: Outline the steps required to sort each sublist and then merge them into a final sorted list.

**Step 5: Sort Each Sublist**
- **Action**: Apply the chosen sorting algorithm to each sublist:
  - Sorted Sublist 1: amanita, annoy, canticle, dissipate, hornblower
  - Sorted Sublist 2: besiege, notre, propylene, sepia, straight
  - Sorted Sublist 3: boggle, california, crocodilian, encephalitis, pasture
  - Sorted Sublist 4: amatory, dexter, dizzy, psychiatric, snipe

**Step 6: Merge Sorted Sublists**
- **Action**: Merge the sorted sublists while maintaining alphabetical order:
  - Final Sorted List: amanita, amatory, annoy, boggle, besiege, california, canticle, crocodilian, dexter, dizzy, dissipate, encephalitis, hornblower, notre, pasture, propylene, psychiatric, sepia, snipe, straight

**Step 7: Verify the Final Sorted List**
- **Action**: Review the final sorted list to confirm accuracy.

**Is the final list correctly sorted alphabetically**
- **Action**: Compare the final list with the expected alphabetical order.

The final answer is:
amanita, amatory, annoy, boggle, besiege, california, canticle, crocodilian, dexter, dizzy, dissipate, encephalitis, hornblower, notre, pasture, propylene, psychiatric, sepia, snipe, straight","```json

### Step-by-Step Execution:

**Step 1: Simplify the Sorting Task**
- **Action**: No duplicates are present, and no obvious patterns need preliminary steps.

**Step 2: Break Down the List into Smaller Groups**
- **Action**: Split the list into smaller sublists:
  - Sublist 1: hornblower, dissipate, amanita, canticle, annoy
  - Sublist 2: besiege, straight, notre, propylene, sepia
  - Sublist 3: california, pasture, encephalitis, boggle, crocodilian
  - Sublist 4: dexter, snipe, amatory, dizzy, psychiatric

**Step 3: Analyze Sorting Techniques**
- **Action**: A simple alphabetical sorting algorithm (e.g., bubble sort) is sufficient.

**Step 4: Create a Step-by-Step Plan for Sorting**
- **Action**: Outline the steps required to sort each sublist and then merge them into a final sorted list.

**Step 5: Sort Each Sublist**
- **Action**: Apply the chosen sorting algorithm to each sublist:
  - Sorted Sublist 1: amanita, annoy, canticle, dissipate, hornblower
  - Sorted Sublist 2: besiege, notre, propylene, sepia, straight
  - Sorted Sublist 3: boggle, california, crocodilian, encephalitis, pasture
  - Sorted Sublist 4: amatory, dexter, dizzy, psychiatric, snipe

**Step 6: Merge Sorted Sublists**
- **Action**: Merge the sorted sublists while maintaining alphabetical order:
  - Final Sorted List: amanita, amatory, annoy, boggle, besiege, california, canticle, crocodilian, dexter, dizzy, dissipate, encephalitis, hornblower, notre, pasture, propylene, psychiatric, sepia, snipe, straight

**Step 7: Verify the Final Sorted List**
- **Action**: Review the final sorted list to confirm accuracy.

**Is the final list correctly sorted alphabetically**
- **Action**: Compare the final list with the expected alphabetical order.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

**Step 1 - Simplify the Sorting Task:**
- Identify any obvious patterns or groupings that can simplify the sorting process.
- Action: Look for words starting with the same letter or similar prefixes.

**Step 2 - Break Down the List into Smaller Groups:**
- Divide the list into smaller, manageable groups based on the first letter of each word.
- Action: Group words by their initial letters.

**Step 3 - Identify Main Challenges:**
- Determine any specific challenges in sorting these words alphabetically.
- Action: Check for words with similar spellings or prefixes that might be easily confused.

**Step 4 - Determine Specific Sorting Techniques or Algorithms:**
- Decide on the sorting technique or algorithm to use.
- Action: Choose a simple alphabetical sorting method, such as the bubble sort or quicksort.

**Step 5 - Create a Step-by-Step Plan to Sort the Words:**
- Outline the detailed steps to sort the words alphabetically.
- Action:
  - Sub-step 1: Group words by their initial letters.
  - Sub-step 2: Sort each group alphabetically.
  - Sub-step 3: Combine the sorted groups into a single list.
  - Sub-step 4: Verify the final sorted list for accuracy.

**Step 6 - Document Each Step Clearly:**
- Record each step of the sorting process for future reference.
- Action: Maintain a log of the sorting process, noting any challenges and how they were addressed.

**Step 7 - Final Verification:**
- Ensure the final sorted list is correct.
- Action: Double-check the sorted list against the original list to confirm accuracy.
